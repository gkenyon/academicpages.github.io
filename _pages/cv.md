_Digital Collections Specialist_

- Worked with curatorial staff to compose web labels for objects and worked with the museum&#39;s digital programs office to link images to object records, export the object records to our Enterprise Digital Asset Network (EDAN), and export the images to our Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) and Image Delivery System (IDS), working to collect, manage, preserve, and provide access to digital content. Performed research to update existing records, wrote new object text, and created new object images and graphics to museum standards.
- Cleared a five-year accession backlog of 28 acquisitions and 341 objects, requested accession numbers, catalogued objects, photographed objects, created new object housing, and moved objects to appropriate storage spaces. Documented and verified information in MIMSY XG for a variety of other objects, and performed collections management functions to aid in the deaccession of both objects and non-collection materials.
- Used institutional knowledge and data tools like OpenRefine, R, and related Shiny apps to help solve inventory reconciliation problems unsolved by inventory teams and other collections specialists.
- Received an Innovation Challenge award of $20,000 as the creator of a web mapping project &quot;Mappable.&quot; The project used GIS systems (Leaflet, GEOjson, ArcGIS) to explore the geography of NMAH collections outside the search box.
- Planned an inventory reconciliation project with colleagues in the Division of Medicine and Science to gain intellectual control over some of the museum&#39;s most difficult cataloguing and legal title issues from previous inventory projects that could only be addressed with institutional knowledge and acquisition&#39;s expertise. Project received federal funding from the National Collections Program.
- Created two new exhibition websites &quot;America on the Move&quot; and &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot; with Drupal. Scanned and photographed over 300 objects and digitized graphics for the websites.

_Collections on the Web Contractor_

- As a contractor on the Collections on the Web team,  published over 30,000 objects to the web and created over 30 new online Object Groups, telling small stories around object. In performing this work, researched and documented objects in every division in the museum using both published and unpublished sources on American material culture. Added memos, object lists, and deeds of gift to acquisition files so they could pass legal title.
- Augmented object cataloging as well as answered queries from the public and other curators working on exhibitions or digital projects. Publishing these records to the web required knowledge of the museum&#39;s functions, standards, methodology, and best practices for the care and preservation of collections through the museum&#39;s database of record, MIMSY XG.
- Responded to loan requests from other institutions including the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Patent Office, and the Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum.
- Published the records for several exhibitions, including &quot;FOOD: Transforming the American Table&quot;, &quot;American Enterprise,&quot; &quot;American Stories,&quot; &quot;Inventing in America,&quot; and the &quot;Object Project. Performed collections management work that included the safe handling and transport of objects to and from Preservation Services, storage, and exhibition staging.
